# Crater Detection using Image Segmentation

I kinda love Space Sciences, therefore I try to find scenarios where machine learning or deep learning techniques can help in the exploration of our universe. We developed telescopes to peek deep into our universe, similarly, we can use artificial intelligence to gain insights about it. So this project was about detecting craters on the moon's surface using a computer vision technique called image segmentation.
